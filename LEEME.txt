    -DETECTING COIN INSERT:
        1. when coin is dropped, coin must STOP MOVING right on top of handle while its visible through the metal vertical slot
        2. rotation of handle must make coin fall (-Y direction)
        3. once coin is not visible, make it dissapear.
        4. open gate
            -gate & gate physics dont exist yet
    
    -GATE:
        -probably just as handle physics, it will be easier to fake (program manually) the displacement instead of real physics, just maybe
